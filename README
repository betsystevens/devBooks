Demonstration of event handling 
  with vanilla JavaScript

User moves pointer over thumbnail images
  to display an enlarged, preview image

HTML displays thumbnails of book covers
CSS uses flexbox to layout thumbnails

Use mouseenter, mousemove & mouseleave events
  to display enlarged image of a thumbnail

Problems: severe jittery display, back and forth on
  mouseenter and mouseleave when preview image extends
  past page bottom.
  Fixed - by adding padding to bottom that extends height
    of preview
